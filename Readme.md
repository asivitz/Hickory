# Hickory

Hickory is a collection of haskell tools and abstractions for making OpenGL based interactive programs. It could be considered a game engine, but it is largely opinionless. Some parts are built to work well with the reactive-banana FRP library. There's built in support for GLFW (for desktop) and iOS.

## Documentation

Proper documentation is lacking for now.  :(
