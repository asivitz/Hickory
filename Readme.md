# Hickory

Hickory is a collection of haskell tools and abstractions for making interactive programs. It could be considered a game engine, but it is largely opinionless. You can use whatever library you want for actually organizing your game logic (e.g. any FRP library, my Layer library, etc...)

It renders using OpenGL and has support for both GLFW (for desktop) and WebGL through GHCJS.
